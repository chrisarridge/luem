# Electromagnetism Example Code
**[Chris Arridge](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/chris-arridge), Lancaster University, c.arridge@lancaster.ac.uk**

This repository contains various pieces of Python 3 code for plotting electrostatic
and magnetostatic configurations and some fluid examples.  It also contains code
for some simplistic calculations of charge distributions.

In the source folder, files with the prefix ``es`` are electrostatic scripts,
``ms`` indicates magnetostatic scripts, ``fl`` indicates a fluid script, and
``cir`` indicates a script for electric circuits.
